# PDFSensei
Developed a PDF-based question-answering chatbot using the Mistral 7B model and Retrieval-Augmented
 Generation (RAG) via the Hugging Face API.
 • Implemented a Gradio interface for user interaction, enabling extraction and processing of PDF content for
 accurate, context-aware responses.
 • Utilized LangChain for model integration, Chroma for vector storage, and custom prompt engineering to enhance
 chatbot performance.
